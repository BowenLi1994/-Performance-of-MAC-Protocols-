This is the project 2 for the Data comm class. We have two programs for this project: traffic_geneorator and simulator.

1. Type "make" to compile the file

2. For traffic_generator program, it will generator the test cases:

   Run syntax is as following:

       ./traffic_generator num_node pkt_size offered_load num_pkts_per_node [seed]

3. For simulator, we implemented three simulators: ALOHA, SLOTTED_ALOHA, CSMA_1 method.
   ./simulator aloha: to run the aloha method
   ./simulator slotted_aloha: to run the slotted_aloha
   ./simulator csma_1: to run the csma_1 method
